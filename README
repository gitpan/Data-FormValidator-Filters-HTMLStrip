NAME
    Data::FormValidator::Filters::HTMLStrip - Filter that removes html tags from input

SYNOPSIS
    use Data::FormValidator::Filters::HTMLStrip qw( html_strip );

    # Build a Data::FormValidator Profile:
    my $my_profile = {
        required => qw( text ),
        field_filters => {
            text => html_strip,
        },
    };

    # Be sure to use a CGI.pm object as the form input
    # when using this filter
    my $q = new CGI;
    my $dfv = Data::FormValidator->check($q,$my_profile);


DESCRIPTION
    This is a Data::FormaValidator filter that acts as a wrapper for HTML::Strip.
    It removes html tags from variable data to help protect against cross-site
    scripting attacks.


FILTERS
  html_strip

    This will create a filter that will strip html tags from
    the value of filtered variables. This assists in protecting cross site
    scripting exploits from users attempting to embed html tags into input
    fields.
